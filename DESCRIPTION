Description: This package allows users to display power analyses for a range 
    of different hypothetical effect sizes. This emphasises the unknown nature of
    the true effect size, and allows more effective communication of power analysis
    as a calibration of a study for various contingencies. This based on the charts
    by Richard Morey in the Jamovi jpower module.
